    <h1>Hi Buddy :)</h1>
      <h3>Iâ€™m a student at Parsons School of Design. I am super passionate about fashion and I feel like I have something to say. Living in my own little art world, I love sharing my ideas with others that like me are immersed within their own little universe.

    <p class="short-bio">Ines Andrea Penaud, is a 20 year old French Communication Design student at Parsons School of Design in New York City. She grew up in between Paris and London. Raised by a French father and a Lebanese/Brazilian mother it is her French side that is currently most reflected in her art. Her comfort with both French and English allows her to mix and match the two languages together communicating ideas through design. Passionate about languages, she also decided to expand that skill by attempting to learn Spanish, which she chose as an elective. In the future, she aims to be fluent in Spanish as well as Italian giving her the skill and ability to produce designs that will incorporate all cultures and languages within them. 
      Overall she aims to work in magazines editorial or advertisement and refuses to be limited and trapped by the barriers of spoken, written or aesthetic languages.  </p>

    <p>Confined within our homes, we all had our fantasy escapes. Looking deeper within this concept of escape, we all wanted to go far even though reality kept us locked in within the 4 walls of our homes. From interviews with 4 different teenagers between ages 14 to 18, these 4 designs represent the identities of each individual. my version of portraiture during this pandemic. These portraits  capture the imagination of each sitter juxtaposed with the reality of our modern times. </p>

<p>
  The power of words. This ironic piece developed around a poster from the Guerrilla Girls,  explores the gender inequality within the art world. 
  The  illustrative quality of the piece embodies the irony of the manifesto in itself.  Giving off a very girly mood, this piece in fact highlights the objectification of women within the art world. The lack of truly female voices within the art world is more and more shocking in our modern times. It was therefore necessary for a young woman designer as myself to attempt to embody the words of the feminist Guerrilla Girls in raising awareness on these gender inequalities. </p>

  Once again contemplating on our modern days and the negative effect confinement has had on young people and more particularity their socialization skills. Within this pandemic, social exclusion is probably what has most impacted our society. The closing of nocturnal festive places may to many have seemed like a minor sacrifice for the general health of a population, however, it is not to be ignored. This sudden restriction has had its draw backs. By closing such places, gouvernements have disabled many young people to socialize in a natural way by creating obstacles to what was before such an easy and natural thing to take part in. Pushing young people to communicate from their homes with the barrier of a screen, our society has never been more digitalized and isolated. This is what this piece evokes in creating a virtual nightclub using a series of screens connected together into one shared space.  </p>
